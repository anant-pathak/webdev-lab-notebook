## Reflection Document

### HTML

Was able to solve the HTML exercises just using the notes from the slides and classroom. Also used HTML resource under MMDN Web Docs.

### Accessibility

Having installed the WAVE Accessibility checker really helped with accessibility benchmarks.

### CSS

CSS, Bootstrap, flex or glid layouts, I was able to solve thanks to the notes, lectures & the Homework exercises (I did the homework first). MMDN Web Docs and the bootstrap 5.0.2 docs really helped too.
